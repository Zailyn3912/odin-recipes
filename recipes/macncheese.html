    <p>This supremely creamy crockpot macaroni and cheese is the way to go when you'd rather not have the oven on. It's as rich as baked macaroni and cheese, without the heat.</p>

        <ul>One pound of uncooked elbow macaroni</ul>
        <ul>Two tablespoons of kosher salt, devided</ul>
        <ul>Cooking spray</ul>
        <ul>One and one half cups of whole milk</ul>
        <ul>Twelve ounces of evaporated milk</ul>
        <ul>One large egg</ul>
        <ul>One large egg yolk</ul>
        <ul>One half cup of butter, cut into pieces</ul>
        <ul>Three ounces of cream cheese, cut into pieces</ul>

    </menu>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <menu>
        <ol>1) Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat; add macaroni and 4 1/2 teaspoons salt. Cook pasta until just barely tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process.</ol>
        <ol>2) Spray the inside of a slow cooker with cooking spray. Add pasta to the slow cooker and stir in milk, evaporated milk, butter, cream cheese and pepper. Whisk together egg and egg yolk in a small bowl until well combined; stir into pasta mixture. Set aside 3/4 cup shredded cheese. Stir remaining cheese into pasta mixture, cover, and cook on Low until bubbly and lightly browned around the edges, about 1 1/2 hours. </ol>
        <ol>3) Sprinkle with reserved cheese, cover, and cook until cheese is melted, about 15 minutes more. Serve immediately. Alternatively, turn crockpot to Warm or Off until ready to serve.</ol>
