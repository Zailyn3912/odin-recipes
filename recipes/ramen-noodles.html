    <h1>Elote Ramen Noodles</h1>
    <p><img src="../img/Ramen.img" width="300" alt="Elote Ramen noodles"></p>
    <p>These elote ramen noodles are fusion at its finest! I grew up eating ramen noodles and kicking them up a notch is my favorite pastime. True elote is grilled, but feel free to cut corners by cooking the corn in a skillet. Your favorite toppings make the dish, so don't skip them.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <menu>
        <ul>Two ears of fresh corn, husked</ul>
        <ul>One small jalapeno pepper</ul>
